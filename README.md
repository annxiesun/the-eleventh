## ABOUT
'The Eleventh' is a product/marketing concept website for a concept calendar company. 

I first started off with a webapp that can generate a calendar for any year the user chooses. The user can also specify which months in that year they want to choose. They can also choose options like 'select all months', 'clear all months', 'select current month & year', which were added to ease the user-experience.

I also thought that user-interactivity like quizzes was a key way many businesses get customers, so I thought this web-app would be a great add-on to a calendar company. With this site, I went for a more elegant but contemporary look, inspired  by magazines like the 'New Yorker' except with calendars. I even made some illustrations to go with the site.
